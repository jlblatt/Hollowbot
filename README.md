# Description

Hollowbot is an attempt to create an open-source framework for a reddit bot to crawl, interpret, and respond to comments.  Users deploying the bot can provide a configuration/ruleset to control its behavior.

/r/hollowbot is its testing sub.

Hollowbot is currently in ALPHA.

# Quickstart

1. Read this entire file before doing anything
2. Move example-conf.py to conf.py and replace default values with your own (bot info, database credentials, etc...)
3. Remove the last line of conf.py
4. Run hollowbot.py (don't forget to chmod +x)
